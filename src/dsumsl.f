C  ***  PURPOSE  ***
C
C        THIS ROUTINE INTERACTS WITH SUBROUTINE  DSUMIT  IN AN ATTEMPT
C     TO FIND AN N-VECTOR  X*  THAT MINIMIZES THE (UNCONSTRAINED)
C     OBJECTIVE FUNCTION COMPUTED BY  CALCF.  (OFTEN THE  X*  FOUND IS
C     A LOCAL MINIMIZER RATHER THAN A GLOBAL ONE.)
C
C--------------------------  PARAMETER USAGE  --------------------------
C
C N........ (INPUT) THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES ON WHICH  F  DEPENDS, I.E.,
C                  THE NUMBER OF COMPONENTS IN  X.
C D........ (INPUT/OUTPUT) A SCALE VECTOR SUCH THAT  D(I)*X(I),
C                  I = 1,2,...,N,  ARE ALL IN COMPARABLE UNITS.
C                  D CAN STRONGLY AFFECT THE BEHAVIOR OF DSUMSL.
C                  FINDING THE BEST CHOICE OF D IS GENERALLY A TRIAL-
C                  AND-ERROR PROCESS.  CHOOSING D SO THAT D(I)*X(I)
C                  HAS ABOUT THE SAME VALUE FOR ALL I OFTEN WORKS WELL.
C                  THE DEFAULTS PROVIDED BY SUBROUTINE DDEFLT (SEE IV
C                  BELOW) REQUIRE THE CALLER TO SUPPLY D.
C X........ (INPUT/OUTPUT) BEFORE (INITIALLY) CALLING DSUMSL, THE CALL-
C                  ER SHOULD SET  X  TO AN INITIAL GUESS AT  X*.  WHEN
C                  DSUMSL RETURNS,  X  CONTAINS THE BEST POINT SO FAR
C                  FOUND, I.E., THE ONE THAT GIVES THE LEAST VALUE SO
C                  FAR SEEN FOR  F(X).
C CALCF.... (INPUT) A SUBROUTINE THAT, GIVEN X, COMPUTES F(X).  CALCF
C                  MUST BE DECLARED EXTERNAL IN THE CALLING PROGRAM.
C                  IT IS INVOKED BY
C                       CALL CALCF(N, X, NF, F, UIPARM, URPARM, UFPARM)
C                  NF IS THE INVOCATION COUNT FOR CALCF.  IT IS INCLUD-
C                  ED FOR POSSIBLE USE WITH CALCG.  IF X IS OUT OF
C                  BOUNDS (E.G., IF IT WOULD CAUSE OVERFLOW IN COMPUT-
C                  ING F(X)), THEN CALCF SHOULD SET NF TO 0.  THIS WILL
C                  CAUSE A SHORTER STEP TO BE ATTEMPTED.  THE OTHER
C                  PARAMETERS ARE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND BELOW.  CALCF
C                  SHOULD NOT CHANGE N, P, OR X.
C CALCG.... (INPUT) A SUBROUTINE THAT, GIVEN X, COMPUTES G(X), THE GRA-
C                  DIENT OF F AT X.  CALCG MUST BE DECLARED EXTERNAL IN
C                  THE CALLING PROGRAM.  IT IS INVOKED BY
C                       CALL CALCG(N, X, NF, G, UIPARM, URPARM, UFAPRM)
C                  NF IS THE INVOCATION COUNT FOR CALCF AT THE TIME
C                  F(X) WAS EVALUATED.  THE X PASSED TO CALCG IS
C                  USUALLY THE ONE PASSED TO CALCF ON EITHER ITS MOST
C                  RECENT INVOCATION OR THE ONE PRIOR TO IT.  IF CALCF
C                  SAVES INTERMEDIATE RESULTS FOR USE BY CALCG, THEN IT
C                  IS POSSIBLE TO TELL FROM NF WHETHER THEY ARE VALID
C                  FOR THE CURRENT X (OR WHICH COPY IS VALID IF TWO
C                  COPIES ARE KEPT).  IF G CANNOT BE COMPUTED AT X,
C                  THEN CALCG SHOULD SET NF TO 0.  IN THIS CASE, DSUMSL
C                  WILL RETURN WITH IV(1) = 65.  THE OTHER PARAMETERS
C                  TO CALCG ARE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND BELOW.  CALCG
C                  SHOULD NOT CHANGE N OR X.
C IV....... (INPUT/OUTPUT) AN INTEGER VALUE ARRAY OF LENGTH LIV (SEE
C                  BELOW) THAT HELPS CONTROL THE DSUMSL ALGORITHM AND
C                  THAT IS USED TO STORE VARIOUS INTERMEDIATE QUANTI-
C                  TIES.  OF PARTICULAR INTEREST ARE THE INITIALIZATION/
C                  RETURN CODE IV(1) AND THE ENTRIES IN IV THAT CONTROL
C                  PRINTING AND LIMIT THE NUMBER OF ITERATIONS AND FUNC-
C                  TION EVALUATIONS.  SEE THE SECTION ON IV INPUT
C                  VALUES BELOW.
C V........ (INPUT/OUTPUT) A FLOATING-POINT VALUE ARRAY OF LENGTH LV
C                  (SEE BELOW) THAT HELPS CONTROL THE DSUMSL ALGORITHM
C                  AND THAT IS USED TO STORE VARIOUS INTERMEDIATE
C                  QUANTITIES.  OF PARTICULAR INTEREST ARE THE ENTRIES
C                  IN V THAT LIMIT THE LENGTH OF THE FIRST STEP
C                  ATTEMPTED (LMAX0) AND SPECIFY CONVERGENCE TOLERANCES
C                  (AFCTOL, LMAXS, RFCTOL, SCTOL, XCTOL, XFTOL).
C LIV...... (INPUT) LENGTH OF IV ARRAY.  MUST BE AT LEAST 60.  IF LIV
C                  IS TOO SMALL, THEN DSUMSL RETURNS WITH IV(1) = 15.
C                  IF LIV IS AT LEAST LASTIV (= 44), THEN THE MINIMUM
C                  ACCEPTABLE VALUE OF LIV IS STORED IN IV(LASTIV)
C                  WHEN DSUMSL RETURNS.  (THIS IS INTENDED FOR USE
C                  WITH EXTENSIONS OF DSUMSL THAT HANDLES CONSTRAINTS.)
C LV....... (INPUT) LENGTH OF V ARRAY.  MUST BE AT LEAST 71+N*(N+15)/2.
C                  (AT LEAST 77+N*(N+17)/2 FOR DSMSNO, AT LEAST
C                  78+N*(N+12) FOR DHUMSL).  IF LV IS TOO SMALL, THEN
C                  DSUMSL RETURNS WITH IV(1) = 16.  IF LIV IS AT LEAST
C                  LASTV (= 45), THEN THE MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE VALUE OF
C                  LV IS STORED IN IV(LASTV) WHEN DSUMSL RETURNS.
C UIPARM... (INPUT) USER INTEGER PARAMETER ARRAY PASSED WITHOUT CHANGE
C                  TO CALCF AND CALCG.
C URPARM... (INPUT) USER FLOATING-POINT PARAMETER ARRAY PASSED WITHOUT
C                  CHANGE TO CALCF AND CALCG.

C  ***  IV INPUT VALUES (FROM SUBROUTINE DDEFLT)  ***
C
C IV(1)...  ON INPUT, IV(1) SHOULD HAVE A VALUE BETWEEN 0 AND 14......
C             0 AND 12 MEAN THIS IS A FRESH START.  0 MEANS THAT
C                  DDEFLT(2, IV, LIV, LV, V)
C             IS TO BE CALLED TO PROVIDE ALL DEFAULT VALUES TO IV AND
C             V.  12 (THE VALUE THAT DDEFLT ASSIGNS TO IV(1)) MEANS THE
C             CALLER HAS ALREADY CALLED DDEFLT AND HAS POSSIBLY CHANGED
C             SOME IV AND/OR V ENTRIES TO NON-DEFAULT VALUES.
C             13 MEANS DDEFLT HAS BEEN CALLED AND THAT DSUMSL (AND
C             DSUMIT) SHOULD ONLY ALLOCATE STORAGE IN IV AND V.
C             14 MEANS THAT A STORAGE HAS BEEN ALLOCATED (E.G. BY A
C             CALL WITH IV(1) = 13) AND THAT THE ALGORITHM SHOULD BE
C             STARTED.  WHEN CALLED WITH IV(1) = 13, DSUMSL RETURNS
C             IV(1) = 14 UNLESS LIV OR LV IS TOO SMALL (OR N IS NOT
C             POSITIVE).  DEFAULT = 12.
C IV(INITH).... IV(25) TELLS WHETHER THE HESSIAN APPROXIMATION H SHOULD
C             BE INITIALIZED.  1 (THE DEFAULT) MEANS DSUMIT SHOULD
C             INITIALIZE H TO THE DIAGONAL MATRIX WHOSE I-TH DIAGONAL
C             ELEMENT IS D(I)**2.  0 MEANS THE CALLER HAS SUPPLIED A

C V(*)........ DDEFLT SUPPLIES TO V A NUMBER OF TUNING CONSTANTS, WITH

C             (I.E., THE APPENDIX TO REF. 1) FOR DETAILS ON V(I),
C             I = DECFAC, INCFAC, PHMNFC, PHMXFC, RDFCMN, RDFCMX,
C             TUNER2, TUNER3, TUNER4, TUNER5.
C
C  ***  (SELECTED) V OUTPUT VALUES  ***
C
C V(DGNORM)... V(1) IS THE 2-NORM OF (DIAG(D)**-1)*G, WHERE G IS THE
C             MOST RECENTLY COMPUTED GRADIENT.
C V(DSTNRM)... V(2) IS THE 2-NORM OF DIAG(D)*STEP, WHERE STEP IS THE
C             CURRENT STEP.
C V(F)........ V(10) IS THE CURRENT FUNCTION VALUE.
C V(F0)....... V(13) IS THE FUNCTION VALUE AT THE START OF THE CURRENT
C             ITERATION.
C V(NREDUC)... V(6), IF POSITIVE, IS THE MAXIMUM FUNCTION REDUCTION
C             POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO THE CURRENT MODEL, I.E., THE FUNC-
C             TION REDUCTION PREDICTED FOR A NEWTON STEP (I.E.,
C             STEP = -H**-1 * G,  WHERE  G  IS THE CURRENT GRADIENT AND
C             H IS THE CURRENT HESSIAN APPROXIMATION).
C                  IF V(NREDUC) IS NEGATIVE, THEN IT IS THE NEGATIVE OF
C             THE FUNCTION REDUCTION PREDICTED FOR A STEP COMPUTED WITH
C             A STEP BOUND OF V(LMAXS) FOR USE IN TESTING FOR SINGULAR
C             CONVERGENCE.
C V(PREDUC)... V(7) IS THE FUNCTION REDUCTION PREDICTED (BY THE CURRENT
C             QUADRATIC MODEL) FOR THE CURRENT STEP.  THIS (DIVIDED BY
C             V(F0)) IS USED IN TESTING FOR RELATIVE FUNCTION
C             CONVERGENCE.
C V(RELDX).... V(17) IS THE SCALED RELATIVE CHANGE IN X CAUSED BY THE
C             CURRENT STEP, COMPUTED AS
C                  MAX(ABS(D(I)*(X(I)-X0(I)), 1 .LE. I .LE. P) /
C                     MAX(D(I)*(ABS(X(I))+ABS(X0(I))), 1 .LE. I .LE. P),
C             WHERE X = X0 + STEP.
C
C-------------------------------  NOTES  -------------------------------
C
C  ***  ALGORITHM NOTES  ***
C
C        THIS ROUTINE USES A HESSIAN APPROXIMATION COMPUTED FROM THE
C     BFGS UPDATE (SEE REF 3).  ONLY A CHOLESKY FACTOR OF THE HESSIAN
C     APPROXIMATION IS STORED, AND THIS IS UPDATED USING IDEAS FROM
C     REF. 4.  STEPS ARE COMPUTED BY THE DOUBLE DOGLEG SCHEME DESCRIBED
C     IN REF. 2.  THE STEPS ARE ASSESSED AS IN REF. 1.
C
C  ***  USAGE NOTES  ***
C
C        AFTER A RETURN WITH IV(1) .LE. 11, IT IS POSSIBLE TO RESTART,
C     I.E., TO CHANGE SOME OF THE IV AND V INPUT VALUES DESCRIBED ABOVE
C     AND CONTINUE THE ALGORITHM FROM THE POINT WHERE IT WAS INTERRUPT-
C     ED.  IV(1) SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED, NOR SHOULD ANY ENTRIES OF IV
C     AND V OTHER THAN THE INPUT VALUES (THOSE SUPPLIED BY DDEFLT).
C        THOSE WHO DO NOT WISH TO WRITE A CALCG WHICH COMPUTES THE
C     GRADIENT ANALYTICALLY SHOULD CALL DSMSNO RATHER THAN DSUMSL.
C     DSMSNO USES FINITE DIFFERENCES TO COMPUTE AN APPROXIMATE GRADIENT.
C        THOSE WHO WOULD PREFER TO PROVIDE F AND G (THE FUNCTION AND
C     GRADIENT) BY REVERSE COMMUNICATION RATHER THAN BY WRITING SUBROU-
C     TINES CALCF AND CALCG MAY CALL ON DSUMIT DIRECTLY.  SEE THE COM-
C     MENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF DSUMIT.
C        THOSE WHO USE DSUMSL INTERACTIVELY MAY WISH TO SUPPLY THEIR
C     OWN DSTOPX FUNCTION, WHICH SHOULD RETURN .TRUE. IF THE BREAK KEY
C     HAS BEEN PRESSED SINCE DSTOPX WAS LAST INVOKED.  THIS MAKES IT
C     POSSIBLE TO EXTERNALLY INTERRUPT DSUMSL (WHICH WILL RETURN WITH
C     IV(1) = 11 IF DSTOPX RETURNS .TRUE.).
C        STORAGE FOR G IS ALLOCATED AT THE END OF V.  THUS THE CALLER
C     MAY MAKE V LONGER THAN SPECIFIED ABOVE AND MAY ALLOW CALCG TO USE
C     ELEMENTS OF G BEYOND THE FIRST N AS SCRATCH STORAGE.
C
C  ***  PORTABILITY NOTES  ***
C
C        THE DSUMSL DISTRIBUTION TAPE CONTAINS BOTH SINGLE- AND DOUBLE-
C     PRECISION VERSIONS OF THE DSUMSL SOURCE CODE, SO IT SHOULD BE UN-
C     NECESSARY TO CHANGE PRECISIONS.
C        INTRINSIC FUNCTIONS ARE EXPLICITLY DECLARED.  ON CERTAIN COM-
C     PUTERS (E.G. UNIVAC), IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO COMMENT OUT THESE
C     DECLARATIONS.  SO THAT THIS MAY BE DONE AUTOMATICALLY BY A SIMPLE
C     PROGRAM, SUCH DECLARATIONS ARE PRECEDED BY A COMMENT HAVING C/+
C     IN COLUMNS 1-3 AND BLANKS IN COLUMNS 4-72 AND ARE FOLLOWED BY
C     A COMMENT HAVING C/ IN COLUMNS 1 AND 2 AND BLANKS IN COLUMNS 3-72.
C        THE DSUMSL SOURCE CODE IS EXPRESSED IN 1966 ANSI STANDARD
C     FORTRAN.  IT MAY BE CONVERTED TO FORTRAN 77 BY COMMENTING OUT ALL
C     LINES THAT FALL BETWEEN A LINE HAVING C/6 IN COLUMNS 1-3 AND A
C     LINE HAVING C/7 IN COLUMNS 1-3 AND BY REMOVING (I.E., REPLACING
C     BY A BLANK) THE C IN COLUMN 1 OF THE LINES THAT FOLLOW THE C/7
C     LINE AND PRECEDE A LINE HAVING C/ IN COLUMNS 1-2 AND BLANKS IN
C     COLUMNS 3-72.  THESE CHANGES CONVERT SOME DATA STATEMENTS INTO
C     PARAMETER STATEMENTS, CONVERT SOME VARIABLES FROM REAL TO
C     CHARACTER*4, AND MAKE THE DATA STATEMENTS THAT INITIALIZE THESE
C     VARIABLES USE CHARACTER STRINGS DELIMITED BY PRIMES INSTEAD
C     OF HOLLERITH CONSTANTS.  (SUCH VARIABLES AND DATA STATEMENTS
C     APPEAR ONLY IN MODULES DITSUM AND DPARCK.  PARAMETER STATEMENTS
C     APPEAR NEARLY EVERYWHERE.)

C IV... INTEGER VALUE ARRAY.
C LIV.. LENGTH OF IV (AT LEAST 60).
C LV... LENGTH OF V (AT LEAST 71 + N*(N+13)/2).
C N.... NUMBER OF VARIABLES (COMPONENTS IN X AND G).
C V.... FLOATING-POINT VALUE ARRAY.
C X.... VECTOR OF PARAMETERS TO BE OPTIMIZED.
C
C  ***  DISCUSSION  ***
C
C        PARAMETERS IV, N, V, AND X ARE THE SAME AS THE CORRESPONDING
C     ONES TO DSUMSL (WHICH SEE), EXCEPT THAT V CAN BE SHORTER (SINCE
C     THE PART OF V THAT DSUMSL USES FOR STORING G IS NOT NEEDED).
C     MOREOVER, COMPARED WITH DSUMSL, IV(1) MAY HAVE THE TWO ADDITIONAL
C     OUTPUT VALUES 1 AND 2, WHICH ARE EXPLAINED BELOW, AS IS THE USE
C     OF IV(TOOBIG) AND IV(NFGCAL).  THE VALUE IV(G), WHICH IS AN
C     OUTPUT VALUE FROM DSUMSL (AND DSMSNO), IS NOT REFERENCED BY
C     DSUMIT OR THE SUBROUTINES IT CALLS.
C        FX AND G NEED NOT HAVE BEEN INITIALIZED WHEN DSUMIT IS CALLED
C     WITH IV(1) = 12, 13, OR 14.
C
C IV(1) = 1 MEANS THE CALLER SHOULD SET FX TO F(X), THE FUNCTION VALUE
C             AT X, AND CALL DSUMIT AGAIN, HAVING CHANGED NONE OF THE
C             OTHER PARAMETERS.  AN EXCEPTION OCCURS IF F(X) CANNOT BE
C             (E.G. IF OVERFLOW WOULD OCCUR), WHICH MAY HAPPEN BECAUSE
C             OF AN OVERSIZED STEP.  IN THIS CASE THE CALLER SHOULD SET
C             IV(TOOBIG) = IV(2) TO 1, WHICH WILL CAUSE DSUMIT TO IG-
C             NORE FX AND TRY A SMALLER STEP.  THE PARAMETER NF THAT
C             DSUMSL PASSES TO CALCF (FOR POSSIBLE USE BY CALCG) IS A
C             COPY OF IV(NFCALL) = IV(6).
C IV(1) = 2 MEANS THE CALLER SHOULD SET G TO G(X), THE GRADIENT VECTOR
C             OF F AT X, AND CALL DSUMIT AGAIN, HAVING CHANGED NONE OF
C             THE OTHER PARAMETERS EXCEPT POSSIBLY THE SCALE VECTOR D
C             WHEN IV(DTYPE) = 0.  THE PARAMETER NF THAT DSUMSL PASSES
C             TO CALCG IS IV(NFGCAL) = IV(7).  IF G(X) CANNOT BE
C             EVALUATED, THEN THE CALLER MAY SET IV(NFGCAL) TO 0, IN
C             WHICH CASE DSUMIT WILL RETURN WITH IV(1) = 65.

C***PURPOSE  Returns integer machine dependent constants
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This is the CMLIB version of I1MACH, the integer machine
C     constants subroutine originally developed for the PORT library.
C
C     I1MACH can be used to obtain machine-dependent parameters
C     for the local machine environment.  It is a function
C     subroutine with one (input) argument, and can be called
C     as follows, for example
C
C          K = I1MACH(I)
C
C     where I=1,...,16.  The (output) value of K above is
C     determined by the (input) value of I.  The results for
C     various values of I are discussed below.
C
C  I/O unit numbers.
C    I1MACH( 1) = the standard input unit.
C    I1MACH( 2) = the standard output unit.
C    I1MACH( 3) = the standard punch unit.
C    I1MACH( 4) = the standard error message unit.
C
C  Words.
C    I1MACH( 5) = the number of bits per integer storage unit.
C    I1MACH( 6) = the number of characters per integer storage unit.
C
C  Integers.
C    assume integers are represented in the S-digit, base-A form
C
C               sign ( X(S-1)*A**(S-1) + ... + X(1)*A + X(0) )
C
C               where 0 .LE. X(I) .LT. A for I=0,...,S-1.
C    I1MACH( 7) = A, the base.
C    I1MACH( 8) = S, the number of base-A digits.
C    I1MACH( 9) = A**S - 1, the largest magnitude.
C
C  Floating-Point Numbers.
C    Assume floating-point numbers are represented in the T-digit,
C    base-B form
C               sign (B**E)*( (X(1)/B) + ... + (X(T)/B**T) )
C
C               where 0 .LE. X(I) .LT. B for I=1,...,T,
C               0 .LT. X(1), and EMIN .LE. E .LE. EMAX.
C    I1MACH(10) = B, the base.
C
C  Single-Precision
C    I1MACH(11) = T, the number of base-B digits.
C    I1MACH(12) = EMIN, the smallest exponent E.
C    I1MACH(13) = EMAX, the largest exponent E.
C
C  Double-Precision
C    I1MACH(14) = T, the number of base-B digits.
C    I1MACH(15) = EMIN, the smallest exponent E.
C    I1MACH(16) = EMAX, the largest exponent E.
C
C  To alter this function for a particular environment,
C  the desired set of DATA statements should be activated by
C  removing the C from column 1.  Also, the values of
C  I1MACH(1) - I1MACH(4) should be checked for consistency
C  with the local operating system.

C***PURPOSE  Processes an error (diagnostic) message.
C***DESCRIPTION
C     Abstract
C        XERROR processes a diagnostic message, in a manner
C        determined by the value of LEVEL and the current value
C        of the library error control flag, KONTRL.
C        (See subroutine XSETF for details.)
C
C     Description of Parameters
C      --Input--
C        MESSG - the Hollerith message to be processed, containing
C                no more than 72 characters.
C        NMESSG- the actual number of characters in MESSG.
C        NERR  - the error number associated with this message.
C                NERR must not be zero.
C        LEVEL - error category.
C                =2 means this is an unconditionally fatal error.
C                =1 means this is a recoverable error.  (I.e., it is
C                   non-fatal if XSETF has been appropriately called.)
C                =0 means this is a warning message only.
C                =-1 means this is a warning message which is to be
C                   printed at most once, regardless of how many
C                   times this call is executed.
C
C     Examples
C        CALL XERROR('SMOOTH -- NUM WAS ZERO.',23,1,2)
C        CALL XERROR('INTEG  -- LESS THAN FULL ACCURACY ACHIEVED.',
C                    43,2,1)
C        CALL XERROR('ROOTER -- ACTUAL ZERO OF F FOUND BEFORE INTERVAL F
C    1ULLY COLLAPSED.',65,3,0)
C        CALL XERROR('EXP    -- UNDERFLOWS BEING SET TO ZERO.',39,1,-1)

C     Abstract
C        XERRWV processes a diagnostic message, in a manner
C        determined by the value of LEVEL and the current value
C        of the library error control flag, KONTRL.
C        (See subroutine XSETF for details.)
C        In addition, up to two integer values and two real
C        values may be printed along with the message.
C
C     Description of Parameters
C      --Input--
C        MESSG - the Hollerith message to be processed.
C        NMESSG- the actual number of characters in MESSG.
C        NERR  - the error number associated with this message.
C                NERR must not be zero.
C        LEVEL - error category.
C                =2 means this is an unconditionally fatal error.
C                =1 means this is a recoverable error.  (I.e., it is
C                   non-fatal if XSETF has been appropriately called.)
C                =0 means this is a warning message only.
C                =-1 means this is a warning message which is to be
C                   printed at most once, regardless of how many
C                   times this call is executed.
C        NI    - number of integer values to be printed. (0 to 2)
C        I1    - first integer value.
C        I2    - second integer value.
C        NR    - number of real values to be printed. (0 to 2)
C        R1    - first real value.
C        R2    - second real value.
C
C     Examples
C        CALL XERRWV('SMOOTH -- NUM (=I1) WAS ZERO.',29,1,2,
C    1   1,NUM,0,0,0.,0.)
C        CALL XERRWV('QUADXY -- REQUESTED ERROR (R1) LESS THAN MINIMUM (
C    1R2).,54,77,1,0,0,0,2,ERRREQ,ERRMIN)

C***PURPOSE  Returns double precision machine dependent constants
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This is the CMLIB version of D1MACH, the double precision machine
C     constants subroutine originally developed for the PORT library.
C
C     D1MACH can be used to obtain machine-dependent parameters
C     for the local machine environment.  It is a function
C     subprogram with one (input) argument, and can be called
C     as follows, for example
C
C          D = D1MACH(I)
C
C     where I=1,...,5.  The (output) value of D above is
C     determined by the (input) value of I.  The results for
C     various values of I are discussed below.
C
C  Double-precision machine constants
C  D1MACH( 1) = B**(EMIN-1), the smallest positive magnitude.
C  D1MACH( 2) = B**EMAX*(1 - B**(-T)), the largest magnitude.
C  D1MACH( 3) = B**(-T), the smallest relative spacing.
C  D1MACH( 4) = B**(1-T), the largest relative spacing.
C  D1MACH( 5) = LOG10(B)

C
C        THIS SUBROUTINE IS CALLED BY AN UNCONSTRAINED MINIMIZATION
C     ROUTINE TO ASSESS THE NEXT CANDIDATE STEP.  IT MAY RECOMMEND ONE
C     OF SEVERAL COURSES OF ACTION, SUCH AS ACCEPTING THE STEP, RECOM-
C     PUTING IT USING THE SAME OR A NEW QUADRATIC MODEL, OR HALTING DUE
C     TO CONVERGENCE OR FALSE CONVERGENCE.  SEE THE RETURN CODE LISTING
C     BELOW.

C--------------------------  PARAMETER USAGE  --------------------------
C
C     IV (I/O) INTEGER PARAMETER AND SCRATCH VECTOR -- SEE DESCRIPTION
C             BELOW OF IV VALUES REFERENCED.
C      D (IN)  SCALE VECTOR USED IN COMPUTING V(RELDX) -- SEE BELOW.
C      P (IN)  NUMBER OF PARAMETERS BEING OPTIMIZED.
C   STEP (I/O) ON INPUT, STEP IS THE STEP TO BE ASSESSED.  IT IS UN-
C             CHANGED ON OUTPUT UNLESS A PREVIOUS STEP ACHIEVED A
C             BETTER OBJECTIVE FUNCTION REDUCTION, IN WHICH CASE STLSTG
C             WILL HAVE BEEN COPIED TO STEP.
C STLSTG (I/O) WHEN ASSESS RECOMMENDS RECOMPUTING STEP EVEN THOUGH THE
C             CURRENT (OR A PREVIOUS) STEP YIELDS AN OBJECTIVE FUNC-
C             TION DECREASE, IT SAVES IN STLSTG THE STEP THAT GAVE THE
C             BEST FUNCTION REDUCTION SEEN SO FAR (IN THE CURRENT ITERA-
C             TION).  IF THE RECOMPUTED STEP YIELDS A LARGER FUNCTION
C             VALUE, THEN STEP IS RESTORED FROM STLSTG AND
C             X = X0 + STEP IS RECOMPUTED.
C      V (I/O) REAL PARAMETER AND SCRATCH VECTOR -- SEE DESCRIPTION
C             BELOW OF V VALUES REFERENCED.
C      X (I/O) ON INPUT, X = X0 + STEP IS THE POINT AT WHICH THE OBJEC-
C             TIVE FUNCTION HAS JUST BEEN EVALUATED.  IF AN EARLIER
C             STEP YIELDED A BIGGER FUNCTION DECREASE, THEN X IS
C             RESTORED TO THE CORRESPONDING EARLIER VALUE.  OTHERWISE,
C             IF THE CURRENT STEP DOES NOT GIVE ANY FUNCTION DECREASE,
C             THEN X IS RESTORED TO X0.

C             START OF THE CURRENT ITERATION).

C             IV(IRC) SHOULD BE SET TO 3 OR 4 (THE VALUE TO WHICH IT IS
C             SET WHEN STEP IS DEFINITELY TO BE ACCEPTED).  ON INPUT

C             UNCHANGED SINCE THE PREVIOUS RETURN OF ASSESS.
C                ON OUTPUT, IV(IRC) IS A RETURN CODE HAVING ONE OF THE

C V(GRDFAC) (OUTPUT) THE COEFFICIENT OF  DIG  IN THE STEP RETURNED --
C             STEP(I) = V(GRDFAC)*DIG(I) + V(NWTFAC)*NWTSTP(I).
C V(GTHG)   (INPUT) SQUARE-ROOT OF (DIG**T) * (HESSIAN) * DIG -- SEE
C             ALGORITHM NOTES.
C V(GTSTEP) (OUTPUT) INNER PRODUCT BETWEEN G AND STEP.
C V(NREDUC) (OUTPUT) FUNCTION REDUCTION PREDICTED FOR THE FULL NEWTON
C             STEP.

C
C  ***  ALGORITHM NOTES  ***
C
C        LET  G  AND  H  BE THE CURRENT GRADIENT AND HESSIAN APPROXIMA-
C     TION RESPECTIVELY AND LET D BE THE CURRENT SCALE VECTOR.  THIS
C     ROUTINE ASSUMES DIG = DIAG(D)**-2 * G  AND  NWTSTP = H**-1 * G.
C     THE STEP COMPUTED IS THE SAME ONE WOULD GET BY REPLACING G AND H
C     BY  DIAG(D)**-1 * G  AND  DIAG(D)**-1 * H * DIAG(D)**-1,
C     COMPUTING STEP, AND TRANSLATING STEP BACK TO THE ORIGINAL

C
C     Four phase method     using two built-in constants that are
C     hopefully applicable to all machines.
C         CUTLO = maximum of  DSQRT(U/EPS)  over all known machines.
C         CUTHI = minimum of  DSQRT(V)      over all known machines.
C     where
C         EPS = smallest no. such that EPS + 1. .GT. 1.
C         U   = smallest positive no.   (underflow limit)
C         V   = largest  no.            (overflow  limit)
C
C     Brief outline of algorithm..
C
C     Phase 1    scans zero components.
C     move to phase 2 when a component is nonzero and .LE. CUTLO
C     move to phase 3 when a component is .GT. CUTLO
C     move to phase 4 when a component is .GE. CUTHI/M
C     where M = N for X() real and M = 2*N for complex.
C
C     Values for CUTLO and CUTHI..
C     From the environmental parameters listed in the IMSL converter
C     document the limiting values are as followS..
C     CUTLO, S.P.   U/EPS = 2**(-102) for  Honeywell.  Close seconds are
C                   Univac and DEC at 2**(-103)
C                   Thus CUTLO = 2**(-51) = 4.44089E-16
C     CUTHI, S.P.   V = 2**127 for Univac, Honeywell, and DEC.
C                   Thus CUTHI = 2**(63.5) = 1.30438E19
C     CUTLO, D.P.   U/EPS = 2**(-67) for Honeywell and DEC.
C                   Thus CUTLO = 2**(-33.5) = 8.23181D-11
C     CUTHI, D.P.   same as S.P.  CUTHI = 1.30438D19

C***DESCRIPTION
C        ***Note*** Machine Dependent Routine
C        FDUMP is intended to be replaced by a locally written
C        version which produces a symbolic dump.  Failing this,
C        it should be replaced by a version which prints the
C        subprogram nesting list.  Note that this dump must be
C        printed on each of up to five files, as indicated by the
C        XGETUA routine.  See XSETUA and XGETUA for details.

C        by the library error handling routines.
C
C     Description of Parameters
C      --Input--
C        IWHICH - Index of item desired.
C                = 1 Refers to current error number.
C                = 2 Refers to current error control flag.
C                 = 3 Refers to current unit number to which error
C                    messages are to be sent.  (0 means use standard.)
C                 = 4 Refers to the maximum number of times any
C                     message is to be printed (as set by XERMAX).
C                 = 5 Refers to the total number of units to which
C                     each error message is to be written.
C                 = 6 Refers to the 2nd unit for error messages
C                 = 7 Refers to the 3rd unit for error messages
C                 = 8 Refers to the 4th unit for error messages
C                 = 9 Refers to the 5th unit for error messages
C        IVALUE - The value to be set for the IWHICH-th parameter,
C                 if ISET is .TRUE. .
C        ISET   - If ISET=.TRUE., the IWHICH-th parameter will BE
C                 given the value, IVALUE.  If ISET=.FALSE., the
C                 IWHICH-th parameter will be unchanged, and IVALUE
C                 is a dummy parameter.
C      --Output--
C        The (old) value of the IWHICH-th parameter will be returned
C        in the function value, J4SAVE.

C***DESCRIPTION
C     Abstract
C        Allows user control over handling of individual errors.
C        Just after each message is recorded, but before it is
C        processed any further (i.e., before it is printed or
C        a decision to abort is made), a call is made to XERCTL.
C        If the user has provided his own version of XERCTL, he
C        can then override the value of KONTROL used in processing
C        this message by redefining its value.
C        KONTRL may be set to any value from -2 to 2.
C        The meanings for KONTRL are the same as in XSETF, except
C        that the value of KONTRL changes only for this message.
C        If KONTRL is set to a value outside the range from -2 to 2,
C        it will be moved back into that range.
C
C     Description of Parameters
C
C      --Input--
C        MESSG1 - the first word (only) of the error message.
C        NMESSG - same as in the call to XERROR or XERRWV.
C        NERR   - same as in the call to XERROR or XERRWV.
C        LEVEL  - same as in the call to XERROR or XERRWV.
C        KONTRL - the current value of the control flag as set
C                 by a call to XSETF.
C
C      --Output--
C        KONTRL - the new value of KONTRL.  If KONTRL is not
C                 defined, it will remain at its original value.
C                 This changed value of control affects only
C                 the current occurrence of the current message.

C     ***  APPLICATION AND USAGE RESTRICTIONS  ***
C
C        THIS ROUTINE IS INTENDED FOR USE WITH QUASI-NEWTON ROUTINES
C     FOR UNCONSTRAINED MINIMIZATION (IN WHICH CASE  ALPHA  COMES FROM
C     THE DIAGONAL OF THE QUASI-NEWTON HESSIAN APPROXIMATION).
C
C     ***  ALGORITHM NOTES  ***
C
C        THIS CODE DEPARTS FROM THE SCHEME PROPOSED BY STEWART (REF. 1)
C     IN ITS GUARDING AGAINST OVERLY LARGE OR SMALL STEP SIZES AND ITS
C     HANDLING OF SPECIAL CASES (SUCH AS ZERO COMPONENTS OF ALPHA OR G).
